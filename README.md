This is an entry of the 2024 gamedev.js jam.
The base 'engine' comes from an Asteroids clone I once wrote for an article.

It was modified to include sound effects, a particle system and it was extended to support a game map over multiple screens. Furthermore enemies were added and the physics were extended to support mines and black holes.

The theme of the game jam is 'power', which was incorperated in the game by including a power bar. The goal of the game is to reach a checkpoint before your power runs out. 

### legal disclaimer ###

All the artwork was made by myself, except for the mine wich was taken from SVG Repo and modified to fit the theme.

All the audio was taken from pixelbay and is supposed to be royalty-free. If you are the creator of such works and it is used without your permission. Please notify me and I will remove it.
